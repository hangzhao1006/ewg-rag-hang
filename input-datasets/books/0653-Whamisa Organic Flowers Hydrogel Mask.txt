Directions: [How to use] Cleanse face with Whamisa's Foam Cleansing Cream and apply a Whamisa toner to rebalance skin before applying mask. Mask comes in two parts, top and bottom. Apply bottom half first. The mask becomes thinner as the serum absorbs into face. Remove the mask after 20~30minutes and gently pat excess serum onto face and neck. Use 2-3times a week for 4weeks.
