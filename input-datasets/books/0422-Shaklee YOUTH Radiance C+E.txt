Warnings: For those new to the YOUTH Advanced Anti-Aging Regimen or YOUTH Activating Serum: Suggest using Radiance C+E only on day(s) or night(s) when you aren't using the YOUTH Activating Serum. Both the Radiance C+E and YOUTH Activating Serum are highly active products and until your skin adjusts, we suggest not using simultaneously when first starting the regimen. Once your skin adjusts, you can use more frequently or simultaneously. If you experience tingling, stinging, dry, or red patches, simply slow usage rate.
