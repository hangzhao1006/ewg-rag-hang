Directions: Following Lipid Serum or on clean, dry skin, apply Hyvia Crème (for intense hydration) or Arctigenin Brightening Treatment (for lighter hydration) to face, neck and décolleté, using a pea-sized portion for each area. Use fingertips to distribute product evenly, then take a few moments to stimulate circulation with feathery upward strokes. Move upward from neck, to cheeks, to the under-eye area - finishing with the forehead. For best results, use twice daily for brightening effects, and add Hyvia Crème at night for intense hydration.
