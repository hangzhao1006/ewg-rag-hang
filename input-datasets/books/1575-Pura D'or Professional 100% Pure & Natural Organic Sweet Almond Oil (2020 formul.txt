Directions: TWO-IN-ONE FACIAL OIL AND POLISH: Why use makeup removers that contain synthetic ingredients that can irritate your skin? When you use our Organic Sweet Almond not only you’re removing stubborn and hard-to-remove waterproof makeup, but you’re also moisturizing your face and reducing the appearance of acne.
GIVE YOUR SKIN A TREAT: Sweet Almond Oil for skin is a great antioxidant because it is rich in A & E vitamins. Even the dark under eye circles don't stand a chance! As an under eye treatment, it reduces the puffiness and dark circles under your eyes. It also helps brighten uneven skin tones so your face is naturally youthful and glowy.
DIY FACIAL POLISH BASE: Just add to your favorite sea salt with a few drops of essential oil to create the perfect gentle facial polish.
