Directions: Liquid Facelift® Usage Guide

We are thrilled for you to start your Liquid Facelift® journey! It's very important to follow these instructions. Liquid Facelift® is a premium potent blend of peptides that must be used very carefully especially for first timers. Follow these instructions for BEST RESULTS.

1. Begin with a thoroughly cleaned and dry face. Avoid other products or chemicals before applying Liquid Facelift®.

2. Gently massage one pearl size amount of Liquid Facelift® into face and neck every other day, gradually increasing to daily use as your skin adjusts.

3. If sensitivity occurs, lessen use frequency and/or dosage until the skin adjusts. If sensitivity persists, cease use, and consult with a physician.
