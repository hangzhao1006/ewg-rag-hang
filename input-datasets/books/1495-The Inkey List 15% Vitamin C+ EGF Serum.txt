The Inkey List 15% Vitamin C+ EGF Serum

Brand: The Inkey List

Category: Serums & Essences

Ingredients: Aqua (Water/Eau), Ascorbyl Glucoside, Sodium Hydroxide, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Butylene Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sodium Metabisulfite, Dehydroacetic Acid, Phytic Acid, Oligopeptide-1.

Directions: Gentle enough for daily use. Can be used in AM and PM, however if only using once per day we recommend AM. On cleansed skin apply a pea-sized amount to face and neck after cleansing and Hyaluronic Acid if you are using. If you would like to use other skin care products on top, wait around 10 minutes before using them. This gives the skin cells enough time to respond to the EGF and it won't affect the cell rejuvenation process. If using in the PM use on a different night to Retinol and AHA exfoliators.

Ingredient concerns: HIGH: Allergies & Immunotoxicity, Use Restrictions; LOW: Cancer, Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity
